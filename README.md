## Project description 
This repository contains the implementation and analysis of an A/B test conducted on Lit Lantern, a fiction mobile reading app. The project aims to optimize user engagement through a series of experiments focusing on click-through rates (CTR), session duration, and session frequency.

## Key Features:


Experiment Design: Detailed design and rationale behind the A/B test, including hypothesis formulation and metric selection.  

Implementation: Codebase for setting up and running the A/B test, ensuring randomized assignment of users to control and treatment groups.  

Data Analysis: Scripts and notebooks for analyzing experiment results, including statistical significance tests and visualizations.  

Results: Summarized findings and conclusions drawn from the experiment.
